# LungCancerDetection

This repository is meant to capture the development towards the Lung Cancer Detection problem posed at kaggle.

Due to the size of the dataset/samples kaggle following link should remain the reference for dataset:

I am still working on the baseline model for the problem. 
Hope to post the first version as soon as I have a meaningful results.
